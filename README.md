## Overview of the Project

### Project: Linear Regression Analysis on petrol_consumption

### Objective
The objective of this task is to implement a linear regression model to predict petrol consumption based on various features and evaluate the model's performance using different metrics and techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

### Key Activities

- **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset and inspect it for structure, missing values, and feature types and to Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between variables.
- **Feature Selection**: Select the relevant features (independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable) for prediction.
- **Data Splitting**:Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
- **Model Training**: Train a simple linear regression model using the training set. Fit the model to learn the relationship between the input features and the target variable.
- **Cross-Validation**: Perform cross-validation to evaluate the model's robustness and generalization capabilities across different subsets of the data.

### Technologie used
- **Python**: The primary language for data analysis, modeling, and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: For loading, manipulating, and analyzing the dataset (e.g., filtering, aggregating, and handling missing values).
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays, especially when performing mathematical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing linear regression, model evaluation, cross-validation, feature scaling, and regularization techniques (Ridge and Lasso regression).
- **Scipy**: Used for statistical operations like outlier detection using Z-scores.
